def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None, start_time=0, cost=1):

    """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
       between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
       produces no output.

    Examples
    --------
    This iterator generates lists of nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]

    You can generate only those paths that are shorter than a certain
    length by using the `cutoff` keyword argument::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3, cutoff=2)
        >>> print(list(paths))
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3]]

    To get each path as the corresponding list of edges, you can use the
    :func:`networkx.utils.pairwise` helper function::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3)
        >>> for path in map(nx.utils.pairwise, paths):
        ...     print(list(path))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 3)]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph using a functional programming approach::

        >>> from itertools import chain
        >>> from itertools import product
        >>> from itertools import starmap
        >>> from functools import partial
        >>>
        >>> chaini = chain.from_iterable
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = partial(nx.all_simple_paths, G)
        >>> list(chaini(starmap(all_paths, product(roots, leaves))))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    The same list computed using an iterative approach::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     for leaf in leaves:
        ...         paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaf)
        ...         all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
    paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
    number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in
    the complete graph of order $n$.
